<p>Command line program to kill the process running on a given port in any operating system.</p>
<p>Unlike many of the other programs out there that do this, this one works in Windows, Linux, and Mac, it is very easily installed in any OS using <code>npm</code> because it is written in Node.js, and it is actively maintained by a <a href="https://rooseveltframework.org/contributors">team</a> of people rather than being just some guy's project from several years ago that may or may not work.</p>
