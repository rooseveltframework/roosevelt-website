      <p>Roosevelt was originally created by <a href="https://github.com/kethinov">Eric Newport</a> in 2013 and has since evolved into a large family of interrelated projects that is the collective work of dozens of direct contributors:</p>

      <p>
        <loop through="contributors" key="name" val="contributor">
          <a href="{contributor.html_url}"><img src="{contributor.avatar_url}" alt="GitHub avatar for: {name}" title="GitHub avatar for: {name}" width="64" height="64"></a>
        </loop>
      </p>

      <p>And is also the work of <a href="https://xkcd.com/2347/">countless indirect contributors</a> who built or contributed code to the dependencies leveraged by the Roosevelt framework project family.</p>

      <p>The current maintainers of Roosevelt are <a href="https://github.com/kethinov">Eric Newport</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Autre31415">Troy Coutu</a>.

      <p>The Roosevelt text logo and parts of this website were designed by <a href="https://kayleigh-east-portfolio.com/">Kayleigh East</a>.</p>
